# Built-in Policies

## Policy Sources

Built-in policies are mainly written in [Rego][rego] and Go.
Those policies are managed under [defsec repository][defsec].

| Config type               | Source               |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Kubernetes                | [defsec][kubernetes] |
| Dockerfile, Containerfile | [defsec][docker]     |
| Terraform                 | [defsec][defsec]     |
| CloudFormation            | [defsec][defsec]     |

For suggestions or issues regarding policy content, please open an issue under the [defsec][defsec] repository.

Ansible are coming soon.
